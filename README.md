# 1. Background
In the world of soccer, the rankings of the teams in a domestic league is usually determined by the number of points they gained as a result of the matches they win. Therefore, winning more matches would equate to placing higher in the leaderboard. I wanted to test a hypothesis of whether a team’s ranking in avg. goals per game compared to the rest of the league would also allow us to confidently predict where on the leaderboard a team would place once the season was over. For this project, I wanted to use data from the English Premier League. 

# 2. Hypothesis
A team’s placement in the leaderboard at the end of the season can be predicted by their placing in the league’s ranking of team’s avg. goals per game and goal difference. 

# 3. Data
What the data represents
The data used for this project was taken from 10 csv files, from EPL season 09-10 to EPL season 18-19. Each csv file has stats on all of the matches played in a particular season. Each row in a csv file represents a match that was played between the home team and the away team. In addition, the full time score of the match, half time score of the match, and more. 

The other data used was 10 text files for the leaderboard rankings of the teams, at the end of each season.
